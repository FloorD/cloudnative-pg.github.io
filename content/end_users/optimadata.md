OptimaData as the Dutch database expert company has done several projects running CloudNativePG for managing Postgres clusters. They were the first to use CloudNativePG in a production environment, even before the operator was released as open source. Back then they did a [benchmark between Zalando's operator, Crunchy Data and CloudNativePG](https://www.optimadata.nl/en/blogs/kubernetes-operators-and-postgres-which-of-the-three/).

<h2 class="text-2xl"></h2>
<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>
<p>For High Availability and Scalability goals, the PostgreSQL database management
system provides administrators with built-in <strong>physical replication</strong>
capabilities based on <strong>Write Ahead Log (WAL) shipping</strong>.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL supports both asynchronous and synchronous streaming replication
over the network, as well as asynchronous file-based log shipping (normally
used as a fallback option, for example, to store WAL files in an object store).
Replicas are usually called <em>standby servers</em> and can also be used for
read-only workloads, thanks to the <em>Hot Standby</em> feature.</p>
<p>Cloud Native PostgreSQL supports clusters based on asynchronous and synchronous
streaming replication to manage multiple hot standby replicas within the same
Kubernetes cluster, with the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>One primary, with optional multiple hot standby replicas for High Availability</li>
<li>Available services for applications:
<ul>
<li><code>-rw</code>: applications connect to the only primary instance of the cluster</li>
<li><code>-ro</code>: applications connect to the only hot standby replicas for read-only-workloads</li>
<li><code>-r</code>: applications connect to any of the instances for read-only workloads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shared-nothing architecture recommended for better resilience of the PostgreSQL cluster:
<ul>
<li>PostgreSQL instances should reside on different Kubernetes worker nodes
and share only the network</li>
<li>PostgreSQL instances can reside in different
availability zones in the same region</li>
<li>All nodes of a PostgreSQL cluster should reside in the same region</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>!!! Seealso &ldquo;Replication&rdquo;
Please refer to the <a href="replication.md">&ldquo;Replication&rdquo; section</a> for more
information about how Cloud Native PostgreSQL relies on PostgreSQL replication,
including synchronous settings.</p>
<p>!!! Seealso &ldquo;Connecting from an application&rdquo;
Please refer to the <a href="applications.md">&ldquo;Connecting from an application&rdquo; section</a> for
information about how to connect to Cloud Native PostgreSQL from a stateless
application within the same Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>!!! Seealso &ldquo;Connection Pooling&rdquo;
Please refer to the <a href="connection_pooling.md">&ldquo;Connection Pooling&rdquo; section</a> for
information about how to take advantage of PgBouncer as a connection pooler,
and create an access layer between your applications and the PostgreSQL clusters.</p>
<h2 id="read-write-workloads">Read-write workloads</h2>
<p>Applications can decide to connect to the PostgreSQL instance elected as
<em>current primary</em> by the Kubernetes operator, as depicted in the following
diagram:</p>
<p><img src="./images/architecture-rw.png" alt="Applications writing to the single primary"></p>
<p>Applications can use the <code>-rw</code> suffix service.</p>
<p>In case of temporary or permanent unavailability of the primary, Kubernetes
will move the <code>-rw</code> service to another instance of the cluster for high availability
purposes.</p>
<h2 id="read-only-workloads">Read-only workloads</h2>
<p>!!! Important
Applications must be aware of the limitations that
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hot-standby.html">Hot Standby</a>
presents and familiar with the way PostgreSQL operates when dealing with
these workloads.</p>
<p>Applications can access hot standby replicas through the <code>-ro</code> service made available
by the operator. This service enables the application to offload read-only queries from the
primary node.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the architecture:</p>
<p><img src="./images/architecture-read-only.png" alt="Applications reading from hot standby replicas in round robin"></p>
<p>Applications can also access any PostgreSQL instance through the
<code>-r</code> service.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cluster-deployments">Multi-cluster deployments</h2>
<p>!!! Info
Cloud Native PostgreSQL supports deploying PostgreSQL across multiple
Kubernetes clusters through a feature called <strong>Replica Cluster</strong>,
which is described in this section.</p>
<p>In a distributed PostgreSQL cluster there can only be a single PostgreSQL
instance acting as a primary at all times. This means that applications can
only write inside a single Kubernetes cluster, at any time.</p>
<p>!!! Tip
If you are interested in a PostgreSQL architecture where all instances accept writes,
please take a look at  <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/">BDR (Bi-Directional Replication) by EDB</a>.
For Kubernetes, BDR will have its own Operator, expected later in 2022.</p>
<p>However, for business continuity objectives it is fundamental to:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduce global <strong>recovery point objectives</strong> (RPO) by storing PostgreSQL backup data
in multiple locations, regions and possibly using different providers
(<strong>Disaster Recovery</strong>)</li>
<li>reduce global <strong>recovery time objectives</strong> (RTO) by taking advantage of PostgreSQL
replication beyond the primary Kubernetes cluster (<strong>High Availability</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to address the above concerns, Cloud Native PostgreSQL introduces the
concept of a <em>PostgreSQL Replica Cluster</em>. Replica clusters are the Cloud
Native PostgreSQL way to enable multi-cluster deployments in private, public,
hybrid, and multi-cloud contexts.</p>
<p>A replica cluster is a separate <code>Cluster</code> resource:</p>
<ol>
<li>having either <code>pg_basebackup</code> or full <code>recovery</code> as the <code>bootstrap</code>
option from a defined external source cluster</li>
<li>having the <code>replica.enabled</code> option set to <code>true</code></li>
<li>replicating from a defined external cluster identified by <code>replica.source</code>,
normally located outside the Kubernetes cluster</li>
<li>replaying WAL information received from the recovery object store
(using PostgreSQL&rsquo;s <code>restore_command</code> parameter), or via streaming
replication (using PostgreSQL&rsquo;s <code>primary_conninfo</code> parameter), or any of
the two (in case both the <code>barmanObjectStore</code> and <code>connectionParameters</code>
are defined in the external cluster)</li>
<li>accepting only read connections, as supported by PostgreSQL&rsquo;s Hot Standby</li>
</ol>
<p>!!! Seealso
Please refer to the <a href="bootstrap.md">&ldquo;Bootstrap&rdquo; section</a> for more information
about cloning a PostgreSQL cluster from another one (defined in the
<code>externalClusters</code> section).</p>
<p>The diagram below depicts a PostgreSQL cluster spanning over two different
Kubernetes clusters, where the primary cluster is in the first Kubernetes
cluster and the replica cluster is in the second. The second Kubernetes cluster
acts as the company&rsquo;s disaster recovery cluster, ready to be activated in case
of disaster and unavailability of the first one.</p>
<p><img src="./images/multi-cluster.png" alt="An example of multi-cluster deployment with a primary and a replica cluster"></p>
<p>A replica cluster can have the same architecture of the primary cluster. In
place of the primary instance, a replica cluster has a <strong>designated primary</strong>
instance, which is a standby server with an arbitrary number of cascading
standby servers in streaming replication (symmetric architecture).</p>
<p>The designated primary can be promoted at any time, making the replica cluster
a primary cluster capable of accepting write connections.</p>
<p>!!! Warning
Cloud Native PostgreSQL does not perform any cross-cluster switchover
or failover at the moment. Such operation must be performed manually
or delegated to a multi-cluster/federated cluster aware authority.
Each PostgreSQL cluster is independent from any other.</p>
<p>The designated primary in the above example is fed via WAL streaming
(<code>primary_conninfo</code>), with fallback option for file-based WAL shipping through
the <code>restore_command</code> and <code>barman-cloud-wal-restore</code>.</p>
<p>Cloud Native PostgreSQL allows you to define multiple replica clusters.
You can also define replica clusters with a lower number of replicas, and then
increase this number when the cluster is promoted to primary.</p>
